## The Var Keyword

The var keywork is for variable decleration where explicit variable type must be provided. example below creating a variable called name of the string type

var name string

if a variable is created using var but not assigned a zero value is assigned to the variable.

Only var decleration is allowed at the package level. The best practice is however is not to work with variable at package levels.
