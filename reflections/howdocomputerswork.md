##How to computers work ?

Computers run on electricity and electricity has two states on or off i.e. 1 or 0. we can now take these two state and encode scheme for information for example if on - you can come trick or treat or if its off - don't come to trick or treat.

So, if we have 1 light we have 2 states
if we have 2 lights we have 2 x 2 states i.e "4"
if we have 3 lights we have 2 x 2 x 2 states "8"
if we have 4 lights we have 2 x 2 x 2 x states "16"

    so the formula is 2 to the power n where n is the no of lights/transistors/chip/cpu

1st generation computers use vaccum tubes first computer eniac had 16000 vaccum tubes
2nd generation computers used transistors
3rd generation computers used Integrated Chips
4th generation computers used Microprocessors - NOW
5th generation ?

MOORE'S LAW
The techinical advancements in the field of computing has allows to make huge strides really quick and taking that into observation. Moore's law states that the ability for us to add transistors to IC doubles every years.

Wiki states : Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years

Computer Memory

bit - short hand for BInary digiTS

1 bits - one state for off or on
8 bits - 1 byte
1024 bytes - 1 KiloByte KB
1024 KB - 1MB megabyte
1024 MB - 1GB gigabyte
1024 GB - 1TB Terabyte
